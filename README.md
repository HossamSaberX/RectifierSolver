# RectifierSolver

A web application for analyzing and solving power electronics circuits, specifically focused on rectifier circuits with various configurations and loads.

## Overview

RectifierSolver helps electrical engineering students and professionals analyze rectifier circuits by calculating key parameters and visualizing important waveforms. The application currently supports:

- Uncontrolled RLE Half Wave rectifiers
- Controlled RLE Half Wave rectifiers
- Uncontrolled RL + Freewheeling Diode configurations

Users can input circuit parameters and instantly see calculated results and waveform visualizations to better understand circuit behavior.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Easy parameter input and instant results
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Calculates current equations, voltage metrics, and performance parameters
- **Visualization**: Generates waveforms for source voltage, output voltage, diode voltage, output current, inductor voltage, and resistor voltage
- **Performance Metrics**: Power on load, power factor, form factor, ripple factor, and efficiency
- **Detailed Guide**: For every calculated parameter, it is given a proper explanation for how to get it manually.
